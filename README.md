# Python-TCP-Time-Server-Client
A simple Python implementation of a TCP server and client for socket programming practice. The server listens for incoming connections and sends the current system time to the client. The client connects to the server, receives the time, and prints it. This project demonstrates the basics of Python networking using the socket library.
